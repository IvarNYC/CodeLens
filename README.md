# CodeLens - GitHub Repository Insights

CodeLens is a web-based tool that offers a visualized and summarized overview of public GitHub repositories. It makes it easier for developers, as well as AI models like ChatGPT, to understand the codebase and assist with debugging tasks.

## How to Use

1. Enter the GitHub repository URL in the designated input field.
2. Press the "Get Insights" button to generate the repository overview.
3. Explore the summary and visualizations created for the chosen repository.

**Note**: Due to GitHub API rate limits for unauthorized requests, you may be limited to 60 requests per hour per IP address.
